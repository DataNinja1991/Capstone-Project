# Capstone-Project
The problem statement can be summarized as a binary classification problem where the inputs are various features describing the financial and behavioral history of the loan applicants, in order to predict whether the loan will be repaid or defaulted.

The purpose of this model is to develop and design an effective and efficient model for Home Credit Default Risk prediction in finance industry. 
In order to deliver a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data like transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.
We will be using various statistical and machine learning methods to make these predictions.

Doing so will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their business to be successful. This necessitates the use of techniques like vintage analysis to establish these definitions based on historical data.
